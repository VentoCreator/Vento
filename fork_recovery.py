fork_recovery.py
================
Deployable, minimal recovery patch for ``pyrotgfork==2.2.24``.

WHY IT IS NEEDED (exact failure path, verified against the installed fork)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Telegram receive path is driven by ``Session.network_worker()``. When the TCP link drops,
``Connection.recv()`` -> ``TCP.recv()`` NEVER raises: it returns ``None`` on timeout/OSError/EOF.
So ``network_worker`` does not die on its own - it schedules a recovery and ``break``s via an
unmanaged ``self.client.loop.create_task(self.restart())`` (session.py line 327).
No reference is retained and no done-callback is attached, so:

* ``Session.start()`` raises e.g. ``TimeoutError`` (builtin, from the initial Ping/InitConnection
  timing out on a half-open socket) -> its ``except Exception`` branch does ``stop(); raise``.
  The raise propagates out of the fire-and-forget ``restart()`` task, which is then reported only
  as ``asyncio ERROR: Task exception was never retrieved`` and NEVER schedules another restart.
* ``Session.start()`` can also RETURN WITHOUT reaching STARTED (its ``except (OSError, RPCError)``
  branch schedules a nested restart and returns), leaving the session not started.

Result: the receiver/recovery is left permanently dead while the process and the event loop stay
alive -> the bot stops answering Telegram updates while unrelated asyncio tasks (UTAG timer, ...)
keep running. This is the production freeze observed after commit a96f605.

FIX (real task-supervision, NOT a time-based watchdog)
------------------------------------------------------
Replace ``Session.restart`` with one coalesced, supervised recovery loop that:
  * keeps a single in-flight flag so only ONE recovery runs at a time (no duplicate receivers,
    no reconnect churn, no multiple concurrent Session objects);
  * retries with capped backoff and logs every failure (the receiver's restart is supervised);
  * VERIFIES the session actually reached STARTED (``is_connected``) before declaring success -
    covering the silent "start() returned without STARTED" case;
  * stops retrying only when the session was deliberately stopped or the client disconnected.
Wrap ``network_worker`` / ``ping_worker`` so any unexpected exception is logged and funnels into the
same supervised recovery instead of silently killing the worker.

This keeps the original ``start``/``stop``/``handle_packet``/``connect`` behaviour untouched; only
`restart`, `network_worker` and `ping_worker` are monkey-patched, so the change is minimal and
reproducible on a stock ``pip install pyrotgfork==2.2.24`` environment.
